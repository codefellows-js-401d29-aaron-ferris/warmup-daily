Daily Warmup
March 25, 2019
## Challenge
[x] Create an array of numbers, 1 through 10
[x] Write a function, called forLoop that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a for(...) loop and does a console.log() of each element.
[x] Write a function, called whileLoop that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a while(...) loop and does a console.log() of each element.
[x] Implement .map(), .filter(), .reduce() as regular javascript functions that take in an array as a parameter, but do the same things as the real functions.
Objects
[x] Implement .map() as regular javascript functions that take in an array as a parameter, but do the same things as the real functions.

[] Implement .reduce() as regular javascript functions that take in an array as a parameter, but do the same things as the real functions.

Objects
[x] Begin with the starter code below …
[x] Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new array called newPeople', which is a copy of the people` array, with a person named ‘Odie’ added to the beginning and one named ‘Garfield’ added to the end.
[x] Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new object called newStuff', which is a copy of the stuff object, with a new car added to the end of the cars` array within it
[x] Create a state object with keys of people and stuff that contain the people and stuff data.
[x] Do this using object destructuring assignment
[x] Using spread and destructuring assignments, create a new object called newSate, repeating the newPeople and newStuff steps above but directly within the people and stuff nodes of the state object (don’t just spread in newPeople and newStuff)
[x] Prove that the original people, stuff, and state are unchanged.

## Tests:
Did not have time to.


### Tests and reduce code Not written due to lab time constraints
